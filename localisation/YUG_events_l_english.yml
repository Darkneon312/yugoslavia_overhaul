 #YO_yugoslavia.1.d:0 "Milan Stojadinović, our Prime Minister, was holding an Exposé in Parliament today, when a man identified as Damjan Arnautović, a macedonian teacher, attempted to assassinate him! Many MPs can confirm that he was annoying the PM during his speech and was asked to keep quiet. Moments later he stood up from his seat and approched the speaking booth. At this point everyone noticed he was drunk, then suddenly he pulled out a revolver and tried to shoot Stojadinović, however he was rescued by Stojadin Dimitrijević, a young MP."
 YO_yugoslavia.1.d:0 "Milan Stojadinović, our Prime Minister, is holding an Exposé in Parliament today, however there is an annoying and suspicious memeber in the audience."

 YO_yugoslavia.20.t:0 "Concordat authorized"
 YO_yugoslavia.20.d:0 "The Regency has finally issued an order authorizing the coalition government Stojadinović-Korošec-Spaho to send the Concordat to the Parliament for ratification."
 YO_yugoslavia.20.a:0 "Excellent."
 YO_yugoslavia.21.t:0 "SPC responds"
 YO_yugoslavia.21.d:0 "The Holy Bishops' Council of the SPC - Serbian Orthodox Church - sent a memorandum to the Regency and the Government stating that the Serbian Orthodox Church could not accept the decision of allowing the pro-catholic Concordat to be ratified."
 YO_yugoslavia.21.a:0 "This doesn't look good."
 YO_yugoslavia.22.t:0 "Serbian Protests over the Concordat"
 YO_yugoslavia.22.d:0 "The Serbian part of the United Opposition is organizing protests of the recent decision to ratify the Concordat."

 YO_yugoslavia.23.t:0 "Disputes in the National Representitive"
 YO_yugoslavia.23.d:0 "Before even its ratification is put on the agenda, the battle over the Concordat had flared up at the National Representative."
 YO_yugoslavia.23.a:0 "This is bad."
 YO_yugoslavia.24.t:0 "Serbian Clergy in support of Vrnava"
 YO_yugoslavia.24.d:0 "On all sides, from all parishes of the Serbian Orthodox Church, telegrams of support to Patriarch Varnava arrived."
 YO_yugoslavia.24.a:0 "What will they do now?"
 YO_yugoslavia.25.t:0 "Anti-government Propaganda"
 YO_yugoslavia.25.d:0 "The Orthodox clergy and the Serbian opposition have started campaigning against the Government. They are giving the public the impression that Serbian Orthodoxy is in grave danger. Patriarch Varnava claims that "the Concordat threatens the principles of state sovereignty, because the will of the Roman Curia is put above the state will, which the Concordat could solve a whole range of legal issues in the state by regulations of the canon law of the Roman Catholic Church.""
 YO_yugoslavia.25.a:0 "Lies and deception."
 YO_yugoslavia.26.t:0 "Varnava's health worsening"
 YO_yugoslavia.26.d:0 "By chance, as the Concordat crisis flared up, the state of health of Patriarch Varnava worsened, and he was transferred to hospital shortly after."
 YO_yugoslavia.26.a:0 "Should we be glad or upset?"
 YO_yugoslavia.27.t:0 "Bloody Walkout"
 YO_yugoslavia.27.d:0 "A Parliament session on the Concordat was scheduled today, but at the same time, a prayer Walkout was scheduled for the healing of the ailing patriarch. However, the police banned the rally. The Walkout was to start from the Cathedral Church in Belgrade to the St. Sava Temple. The main organizer of the Walkout was the Bishop of Ohrid and Žice, Nikolaj Velimirović. Conceived "as a major church-folk manifestation in the fight against the Concordat", the Walkout headed to Knez Mihailova Street. There was a clash between citizens and police in Knez Mihalova, as the gendarmerie had been ordered to prevent protesters from passing the National Assembly. Gendarmerie intervention was brutal, although the injuries to lithium participants were somewhat exaggerated. People's demonstrations also take place across Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and the Krajina."
 YO_yugoslavia.27.a:0 "This a PR disaster."
 YO_yugoslavia.28.t:0 "Concordat passes Parliament"
 YO_yugoslavia.28.d:0 "The Concordat was voted in the Parliament with 166 votes in favor, with 129 against. It should have been voted down in the Senate, but Stojadinović announced to members of the JRZ that he would wait for some time to present Concordat to the Senate. At the end of the day, when Concordat was voted in the lower house of the Yugoslav parliament, Patriarch Varnava died. Rumors that the patriarch was poisoned at the behest of the Government immediately erupted inside the Church and in public. All members of the Government, except the Minister of Military General Maric, were forbidden by the Church to attend the funeral."
 YO_yugoslavia.28.a:0 "Yet again, should we be glad or upset?"
 
 #YO_yugoslavia.2.t:0 "Ljubomir Davidović passes away"
 #YO_yugoslavia.2.d:0 "Ljubomir Davidović, the creator of Demokratska Stranka has recently passed away.

 #YO_yugoslavia.2.a:0 "May he rest in peace."
 #YO_yugoslavia.3.t:0 "The Croatian Question and Stojadinović"
 #YO_yugoslavia.3.d:0 "Since his election as prime minister in 1935, Milan Stojadinović proved to be ineffective in solving the Croatian Question. His incompetence has left Prince Paul with no choice but to remove him from his position."
 #YO_yugoslavia.3.a:0 "He will be putting Dragiša Cvetković in power."
 #YO_yugoslavia.4.t:0 "1938 Election"
 #YO_yugoslavia.4.d:0 "The time has come for the parliamentary elections of 1938. The previous election of 1935 resulted in a victory for the JRZ now under Milan Stojadinović. The United Opposition primariy consisting of croatian parties under Vladko Maček are running against Stojadinović. What will be the outcome?"
